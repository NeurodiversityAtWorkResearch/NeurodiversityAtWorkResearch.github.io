<h2>Call for Research Submissions</h2>

<p>Sharing your research and the lessons you learned from conducting 
    that research is critical to the evolution of this area of study 
    and contributes to the overall well-being of our scholarly community.  
    We invite submissions of complete research, research-in-progress, and 
    research ideas and proposals. We welcome innovative, inspiring research 
    with the aim to have a clear impact on the preparation, recruitment, 
    persistence, and/or advancement of neurodivergent people in the workplace. 
    Submitted work may be conceptual, analytical, design-oriented, or empirical 
    in nature. One goal of the workshop is to provide an opportunity to receive 
    constructive feedback to advance and improve your work. We strongly encourage 
    submissions relevant to the theme of the conference but continue to accept 
    general papers relevant to the preparation, recruitment, persistence, 
    and/or advancement of neurodivergent people in the workplace more broadly.</p>

<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>

<p>The primary criteria for acceptance of a submitted paper are the scientific quality of the paper and the 
    potential contribution to neurodiversity employment research and practice. To this end, consider these three criteria:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Relevance to the workshop: The extent to which a paper meets the workshop goals and may relate to the 
            preparation, recruitment, persistence, and advancement of neurodivergent individuals in the workplace.
        </li>
        <li>
            Potential scholarly contribution: The scientific quality of the submission relative to the theoretical 
            grounding and/or methodological clarity and empirical rigor as well as originality of the paper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Broader impact: The relevance of the work to neurodiversity employment practice and its potential for impact on society. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Quality of presentation: The quality of the writing and organization of ideas and conclusions.
        </li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. Papers submitted to the 
    Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference must not have been 
    published elsewhere while under consideration for the Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference. 
    Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific 
    ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. 
</p>

<h2>
    Submission Format
</h2>
    <p>We welcome contributions in the following forms:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Complete research papers (7-10 pages): Completed research must describe empirical or conceptual 
            work that is fully developed and ready to be communicated to the research community. Completed 
            research papers may be theoretical/conceptual or empirical.
        </li>
        <li>
            Research-in-progress papers (2-5 pages): Research-in-progress papers describe empirical or conceptual 
            work that is in the earlier stages of execution or completion. In empirical efforts, the work may contain 
            pilot data or present a conceptual framework with hypotheses to be tested, and research design to execute. 
            In conceptual work, the authors have early versions of their theory development to be shared. Authors may 
            be looking for feedback related to theory or research design they wish to feedback on. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Research ideas and proposals (1-2 pages): A research idea contains a problem statement and a set of research 
            questions to be investigated.
        </li>
        <li>
            For all submission categories, references may extend as many pages beyond the page limit as you need.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        All submissions must be written in English. They must include a title, a list of authorsâ€™ names, affiliations, 
        and email addresses, and a 200-word abstract. Papers should be single-spaced, single-column, with a font size of 
        11-12 points in Times New Roman. Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected.
    </p>
    <h2>
