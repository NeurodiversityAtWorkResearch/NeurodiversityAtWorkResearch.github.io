 <h2 style="color:red">Submissions for the Research Conference are DUE by 5 pm PDT, Monday, March 26, 2026.</h2> 

 <p>Sharing your research and the lessons you learned from conducting that research is critical to the evolution of this area of study and contributes to the overall well-being of our scholarly community.  We invite submissions of completed research, research-in-progress, research ideas, and overview of research grants. We welcome innovative, inspiring research that explores topics related to “Building Adaptability and Resilience in the Age of Disruption.” Submitted work may be conceptual, critical, analytical, design-oriented, or empirical in nature. One goal of the conference is to provide an opportunity to receive constructive feedback to advance and improve your work. We strongly encourage submissions relevant to the conference's theme, but we continue to accept general papers on the preparation, recruitment, persistence, and/or advancement of neurodivergent people in the workplace more broadly.

</p>
<h2>Evaluation Criteria</h2>
<p>The primary criteria for acceptance of a submitted paper are the scientific quality of the paper and the potential contribution to neurodiversity employment research and practice. To this end, consider these three criteria:

</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
      Relevance to the conference: The extent to which a paper meets the conference goals and may relate to the preparation, recruitment, persistence, and advancement of neurodivergent individuals in the workplace.
    </li>
    <li>
      Potential scholarly contribution: The scientific quality of the submission relative to the theoretical grounding and/or methodological clarity and empirical rigor, as well as originality of the paper. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Broader impact: The relevance of the work to neurodiversity employment practice and its potential for impact on society. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Quality of presentation: The quality of the writing and organization of ideas and conclusions.
  </ul>
<p>Each submission will be reviewed by at least two members of the program committee. </p>

<p>
  Papers submitted to the Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference must not have been submitted or published elsewhere while under consideration for the Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. 
</p>
<p>
  In line with other conferences, we employ the following policy on the use of Large Language Models in paper writing. Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), for example, ChatGPT or Gemini, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing or proofreading the author’s own words. Authors are responsible for the content of their papers, including not only the accuracy of the citations, but also the paper’s description of what the cited work actually says. We will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked or where an LLM is not appropriately used (e.g., including fake references generated by LLM, relying on AI-tools to generate ideas in the submission, etc.). 
</p>
<h2>Submission Format</h2>
<p>We welcome contributions in the following forms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Complete research papers (8-10 pages):</b> Completed research must describe theoretical/conceptual or empirical work that is fully developed and ready to be communicated to the research community. All complete research paper submissions should include a thorough discussion of research literature related to their topic. Submissions should conform to a paper structure that is well-accepted in the authors’ academic discipline. For example, empirical research in human-computer interaction always has this paper structure: Introduction, Related Work, Methodology (Participant Recruitment or Data Sources, Tasks, Analyses, Positionality), Findings, Discussion, Limitations of the Study, Conclusion. Accepted complete research papers will be presented as a talk at the conference.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Research-in-progress papers (4-5 pages):</b> Research-in-progress papers describe empirical or conceptual work that is in the earlier stages of execution or completion. In empirical efforts, the work may contain preliminary data and results or present a conceptual framework with hypotheses to be tested, and/or research design to execute. In conceptual work, the authors have early versions of their theory development to be shared. Authors may seek feedback on the theory or research design they wish to pursue. All submissions should include a thorough discussion of research literature related to their topic. Accepted research-in-progress papers will be presented as a talk at the conference.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Research ideas (1-2 pages):</b> A research idea contains a problem statement and a set of research questions to be investigated. Submissions must include a list of questions that authors would like conference attendees reading their work to answer at the conference. Research idea papers need not include a thorough literature review, though if the idea has been inspired by prior work, it should be cited. Accepted research ideas will be presented as a poster at the conference.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Grant Descriptions (2-3 pages):</b> A grant description tells the world about the great ideas in your funded (or unfunded) research grant proposal. Submissions must describe the vision motivating the grant, the research questions, the core activities described in the grant, the evaluation methods, and success metrics. Submissions must include the grant’s funding agency.  Accepted grant descriptions will be presented as a poster at the conference.  </li>
  <li>
    For all submission categories, references may extend as many pages beyond the page limit as you need.</li>
  </ul>
 
<p>
  This conference uses a double-blind reviewing process. Submissions must be anonymized, i.e., <b>do not write your names or affiliations inside the submission document</b>. In the submission, reference your own work in the third person to avoid revealing your identity to the reviewers. All submissions must be written in English. They must include a title and a 200-word abstract. Papers should be single-spaced, single-column, with a font size of 11-12 points in Times New Roman. Submissions should be uploaded in PDF or Microsoft Word formats. Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected.
</p>
<h2>How to Submit</h2>
<p>
  Submissions for the Research Conference are DUE by 5 pm PDT, Monday, March 26, 2026.
</p> 
<p>Papers should be submitted electronically to 
  <a href="https://nwrc2026.hotcrp.com/">HotCRP</a>.
