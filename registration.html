  Registration for the Neurodiversity at Work Research Conference will be open soon.
</p>

<p>
  Each year, we hope to attract and support junior scholars and scholars 
  from low-resourced institutions to participate in the Neurodiversity at 
  Work Research Conference. We provide scholarships based on need. 
  The number of scholarships and their dollar amount (between $75 and $500) 
  is dependent on the number of registrants and amount of sponsorships we receive. 
  We will review all requests in mid-April. 
</p>
<p>
